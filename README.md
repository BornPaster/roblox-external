---------------------------------------

### Requirements
* Windows OS
* FishStrap (for production channel)

---------------------------------------

### Usage
* download fishtrap and make sure you're on the main production channel (currently is f6cd26d0e71b47c9)
* make sure you're in a game and run the python script

---------------------------------------

### Notes
* this is just a base, it only returns player names, positions, and health
* if you're not a skid you should be able to make a good external with esp and aimbot
* star the repo if you end up liking what you see <3

### Credits
* Yub-X: external base for me to learn off of
* [robloxoffsets.com](https://robloxoffsets.com): updated roblox offsets
